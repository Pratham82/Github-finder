# Github-finder 🔍

I have created a github information finder. I used **ES6 classes** and created multiple JS files for modularization. I got a strong understanding of **DOM**. I have learned **async await**, API calls with **github API** and much more with this app.

- Review latest repositories
- Implementation of Github API
- Implementation of ES6 Features
- Async await for API calls

#### Dependencies
- Github API. After logging in go to this 🔗 [site](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and crete a new app with appropriate info. You will get client_id and client_secret which is required for this application. Add those credential and you're good to go 😄.
